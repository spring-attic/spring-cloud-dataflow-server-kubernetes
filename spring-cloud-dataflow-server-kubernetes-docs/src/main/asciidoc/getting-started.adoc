= Getting Started

http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/[Spring Cloud Data Flow] is a toolkit for building data integration and real-time data processing pipelines.

Pipelines consist of Spring Boot apps, built using the Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Cloud Task microservice frameworks. This makes Spring Cloud Data Flow suitable for a range of data processing use cases, from import/export to event streaming and predictive analytics.

This project provides support for using Spring Cloud Data Flow with Kubernetes as the runtime for these pipelines with apps packaged as Docker images.

== Installation

In this section we will install the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server on a Kubernetes cluster.
Spring Cloud Data Flow depends on a few services and their availability.
For example, we need an RDBMS service for the app registry, stream/task repositories and task management.
For streaming pipelines, we also need a transport option such as Apache Kafka or Rabbit MQ.
In addition to this, we need a Redis service if the analytics features are in use.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This guide describes setting up an environment for testing Spring Cloud Data Flow on Google Kubernetes Engine and is not meant to be a definitive guide for setting up a production environment. Feel free to adjust the suggestions to fit your test set-up. Please remember that a production environment requires much more consideration for persistent storage of message queues, high availability, security etc.
====

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only apps registered with a `--uri` property pointing to a Docker resource are supported by the Data Flow Server for Kubernetes.

Note that we do support Maven resources for the `--metadata-uri` property.

E.g. the below app registration is valid:

[source,console,subs=attributes]
----
dataflow:>app register --type source --name time --uri docker://springcloudstream/time-source-rabbit:{docker-time-source-rabbit-version} --metadata-uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:time-source-rabbit:jar:metadata:{docker-time-source-rabbit-version}
----

but any app registered with a Maven, HTTP or File resource for the executable jar (using a `--uri` property prefixed with `maven://`, `http://` or `file://`) is *_not supported_*.

=== Kubernetes Compatibility

The Spring Cloud Data Flow implementation for Kubernetes uses link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes[Spring Cloud Deployer Kubernetes]
library for orchestration. Before you begin setting up Kubermetes cluster, refer to the link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes#kubernetes-compatibility[compatibility-matrix]
to learn more about the deployer/server compatibility against Kubernetes release versions.

=== Create a Kubernetes cluster

The Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/[Picking the Right Solution] guide lets you choose among many options so you can pick one that you are most comfortable using.

All our testing is done using the https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/[Google Kubernetes Engine] that is part of the Google Cloud Platform. That is a also the target platform for this section. We have also successfully deployed using https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/[Minikube] and we will note where you need to adjust for deploying on Minikube.

NOTE: When starting Minikube you should allocate some extra resources since we will be deploying several services. We have used `minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=4096` to start.

The rest of this getting started guide assumes that you have a working Kubernetes cluster and a `kubectl` command line utility. See the docs for installation instructions: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/[Installing and Setting up kubectl].


=== Deploying using kubectl

. Get the Kubernetes configuration files.
+
There are sample deployment and service YAML files in the https://github.com/{github-repo}[https://github.com/{github-repo}] repository that you can use as a starting point. They have the required metadata set for service discovery by the different apps and services deployed. To check out the code enter the following commands:
+
[source,console,subs=attributes]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/{github-repo}
$ cd spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes
$ git checkout {github-tag}
----
+
. Deploy Rabbit MQ.
+
The Rabbit MQ service will be used for messaging between modules in the stream.  You could also use Kafka, but, in order to simplify, we only show the Rabbit MQ configurations in this guide.
+
Run the following commands to start the Rabbit MQ service:
+
```
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/rabbitmq/
```
+
You can use the command `kubectl get all -l app=rabbitmq` to verify that the deployment, pod and service resources are running. Use the command `kubectl delete all -l app=rabbitmq` to clean up afterwards.
+
. Deploy MySQL.
+
We are using MySQL for this guide, but you could use Postgres or H2 database instead. We include JDBC drivers for all three of these databases, you would just have to adjust the database URL and driver class name settings.
+
IMPORTANT: You can modify the password in the `src/kubernetes/mysql/mysql-deployment.yaml` files if you prefer to be more secure. If you do modify the password you will also have to provide it base64 encoded in the `src/kubernetes/mysql/mysql-secrets.yaml` file.
+
Run the following commands to start the MySQL service:
+
```
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/mysql/
```
You can use the command `kubectl get all -l app=mysql` to verify that the deployment, pod and service resources are running. Use the command `kubectl delete all,pvc,secrets -l app=mysql` to clean up afterwards.
+
. Deploy Redis.
+
The Redis service will be used for the analytics functionality. Run the following commands to start the Redis service:
+
```
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/redis/
```
+
NOTE: If you don't need the analytics functionality you can turn this feature off by changing `SPRING_CLOUD_DATAFLOW_FEATURES_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` to false in the `src/kubernetes/server/server-deployment.yaml` file. If you don't install the Redis service then you should also remove the Redis configuration settings in `src/kubernetes/server/server-config-kafka.yaml` mentioned below.
+
You can use the command `kubectl get all -l app=redis` to verify that the deployment, pod and service resources are running. Use the command `kubectl delete all -l app=redis` to clean up afterwards.
+
. Deploy the Metrics Collector.
+
The Metrics Collector will provide message rates for all deployed stream apps. These message rates will be visible in the Dashboard UI. Run the following commands to start the Metrics Collector:
+
```
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/metrics/metrics-deployment-rabbit.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/metrics/metrics-svc.yaml
```
+
You can use the command `kubectl get all -l app=metrics` to verify that the deployment, pod and service resources are running. Use the command `kubectl delete all -l app=metrics` to clean up afterwards.
+
. Deploy Skipper
+
Optionally, you can deploy link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/[Skipper] to leverage the features of upgrading and
rolling back Streams since Data Flow delegates to Skipper for those features. For more details, review Spring Cloud Skipper's
link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/{skipper-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#overview[reference guide]
for a complete overview and its feature capabilities.
+
IMPORTANT: You should specify the version Skipper that you want to deploy.
+
The deployment is defined in the `src/kubernetes/skipper/skipper-deployment.yaml` file. To control what version of Skipper that gets deployed you should modify the tag used for the Docker image in the container spec:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: skipper
        image: springcloud/spring-cloud-skipper-server:1.0.2.RELEASE   # <1>
        imagePullPolicy: Always
----
+
<1> You may change the version as you like.
+
NOTE: Skipper includes the concept of link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-platforms[platforms],
so it is important to define the "accounts" based on the project preferences. In the above YAML file, the accounts map
to `minikube` as the platform. This can be modified, and of course, you can have any number of platform definitions.
More details are in Spring Cloud Skipper reference guide.
+

[NOTE]
====
If you'd like to orchestrate stream processing pipelines with Apache Kafka as the messaging middleware using Skipper, you must change
the values in the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` environment variable:

[source,yaml,options=nowrap]
----
"{\"spring.cloud.skipper.server.platform.kubernetes.accounts.minikube.environmentVariables\" :
\"SPRING_CLOUD_STREAM_KAFKA_BINDER_BROKERS=${KAFKA_SERVICE_HOST}:${KAFKA_SERVICE_PORT},
SPRING_CLOUD_STREAM_KAFKA_BINDER_ZK_NODES=${KAFKA_ZK_SERVICE_HOST}:${KAFKA_ZK_SERVICE_PORT}\"}"
----
====
+
Run the following commands to start Skipper as the companion server for Spring Cloud Data Flow:
+
```
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/skipper/skipper-deployment.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/skipper/skipper-svc.yaml
```
+
You can use the command `kubectl get all -l app=skipper` to verify that the deployment, pod and service resources are running. Use the command `kubectl delete all -l app=skipper` to clean up afterwards.
+
. Deploy the Data Flow Server.
+
IMPORTANT: You should specify the version of the Spring Cloud Data Flow server that you want to deploy.
+
The deployment is defined in the `src/kubernetes/server/server-deployment.yaml` file. To control what version of the Spring Cloud Data Flow server that gets deployed you should modify the tag used for the Docker image in the container spec:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: scdf-server
        image: springcloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes:1.5.0.M1   # <1>
        imagePullPolicy: Always
----
+
<1> Change the version as you like. This document is based on the `{project-version}` release. The docker tag `latest` can be used for `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` releases.
+
[NOTE]
====
To use Skipper, you _must_ uncomment the following properties to `src/kubernetes/server/server-deployment.yaml`. under the `env:` section

[source,yaml,options=nowrap]
----

 - name: SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_CLIENT_SERVER_URI
   value: 'http://${SKIPPER_SERVICE_HOST}/api'
 - name: SPRING_CLOUD_DATAFLOW_FEATURES_SKIPPER_ENABLED
   value: 'true'
----
====
+
The Data Flow Server uses the https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client[Fabric8 Java client library] to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.  We are using environment variables to set the values needed when deploying the Data Flow server to Kubernetes. We are also using the https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes[Fabric8 Spring Cloud integration with Kubernetes library] to access Kubernetes http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/[ConfigMap] and http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/[Secrets] settings.
The ConfigMap settings are specified in the `src/kubernetes/server/server-config-rabbit.yaml` file and the secrets are in the `src/kubernetes/mysql/mysql-secrets.yaml` file. If you modified the password for MySQL you should have changed it in the `src/kubernetes/mysql/mysql-secrets.yaml` file. Any secrets have to be provided base64 encoded.
+
NOTE: We are now configuring the Data Flow server with file based security and the default user is 'user' with a password of 'password'. Feel free to change this in the `src/kubernetes/server/server-config-rabbit.yaml` file.
+
NOTE: The default memory for the pods is set to 1024Mi.  Update the value in the `src/kubernetes/server/server-deployment.yaml` file if you expect most of your apps to require more memory.
+
IMPORTANT: The latest releases of kubernetes have enabled https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC] on the api-server. If your target platform has RBAC enabled you must ask a `cluster-admin` to create the `roles` and `role-bindings` for you before deploying the dataflow server. They associate the dataflow service account with the roles it needs to be run with.
+
```
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-roles.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-rolebinding.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/service-account.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-config-rabbit.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-svc.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-deployment.yaml
```
+
You can use the command `kubectl get all -l app=scdf-server` to verify that the deployment, pod and service resources are running. Use the command `kubectl delete all,cm -l app=scdf-server` to clean up afterwards. To cleanup roles, bindings and the service account, use the following commands:
+
```
$ kubectl delete role scdf-role
$ kubectl delete rolebinding scdf-rb
$ kubectl delete serviceaccount scdf-sa
```
+
Use the `kubectl get svc scdf-server` command to locate the EXTERNAL_IP address assigned to `scdf-server`, we will use that later to connect from the shell.
+
```
$ kubectl get svc scdf-server
NAME         CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)    AGE
scdf-server  10.103.246.82    130.211.203.246   80/TCP     4m
```
So the URL you need to use is in this case http://130.211.203.246
+
If you are using Minikube then you don't have an external load balancer and the EXTERNAL-IP will show as `<pending>`. You need to use the NodePort assigned for the `scdf-server` service. Use this command to look up the URL to use:
+
```
$ minikube service --url scdf-server
http://192.168.99.100:31991
```

== Helm Installation

Spring Cloud DataFlow offers a https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow[Helm Chart] for deploying
the Spring Cloud Data Flow server and its required services to a Kubernetes Cluster.

NOTE: The helm chart is available since the 1.2 GA release of Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes.

The following instructions cover how to initialize `Helm` and install Spring Cloud Data Flow on a Kubernetes cluster.

. Installing Helm
+
`Helm` is comprised of two components: one is the client (Helm) the other is the server (Tiller).
The `Helm` client is run on your local machine and can be installed using the following instructions found
https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/README.md#install[here].
If Tiller has not been installed on your cluster, execute the following `Helm` client command:
+
```
$ helm init
```
NOTE: To verify that the `Tiller` pod is running execute the following command: `kubectl get pod --namespace kube-system` and you should see the `Tiller` pod running.
+
. Installing the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server and required services.
+
Before we can run the Spring Cloud Data Flow Chart, we need to access the incubator repository where it currently resides.
To add this repository to our `Helm` install, execute the following commands:
+
```
helm repo add incubator https://kubernetes-charts-incubator.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
```
+
To install Spring Cloud Data Flow and its required services execute the following:
+
```
helm install --name my-release incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow
```
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are running on a Kubernetes cluster without a load balancer, such as in Minikube, then you should override the service type to use NodePort.
Add the `--set server.service.type=NodePort` override:

[source,console]
----
helm install --name my-release --set server.service.type=NodePort \
    incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are running on a Kubernetes cluster without RBAC, such as in minikube, then you should override `rbac.create` to `false`. By default, it is set to `true` based on best practices.
Add the `--set rbac.create=false` override:

[source,console]
----
helm install --name my-release --set server.service.type=NodePort \
    --set rbac.create=false \
    incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow
----
====
+
If you wish to specify a different version of Spring Cloud Data Flow besides the
current GA release, you can set the `server.version` as shown below:
+
```
helm install --name my-release incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow --set server.version=<version-you-want>
```
+
NOTE: To see all of the settings that can be configured on the Spring Cloud Data Flow chart, check out the https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow/README.md[README].

+
[NOTE]
====
Here's Spring Cloud Data Flow's Kubernetes version compatibility with the respective Helm Chart releases.

NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of the server by running 'kubectl get svc -w my-release-data-flow-server'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default my-release-data-flow-server -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:80
----
+
You have just created a new release in the default namespace of your Kubernetes cluster.
The notes section gives instructions for connecting to the newly installed server.
It takes a couple of minutes for the application and its required services to start up.
You can check on the status by issuing a `kubectl get pod -w` command.
Wait for the READY column to show "1/1" for all pods. Once that is done, you can
connect to the Data Flow server using the external ip listed via a
`kubectl get svc my-release-data-flow-server` command.
The default username is `user`, and the password is `password`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are running on Minikube then you can use the following command to get the URL for the server:

[source,console]
----
minikube service --url my-release-data-flow-server
----
====
+
To see what `Helm` releases you have running, you can use the `helm list` command.
When it is time to delete the release, run `helm delete my-release`.
This removes any resources created for the release but keeps release information
so you can rollback any changes using a `helm rollback my-release 1` command.
To completely delete the release and purge any release metadata, use `helm delete my-release --purge`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
There is an https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/issues/980[issue] with
generated secrets used for the required services getting
rotated on chart upgrades. To avoid this set the password for these services
when installing the chart. You can use:

[source,console]
----
helm install --name my-release \
    --set rabbitmq.rabbitmqPassword=rabbitpwd \
    --set mysql.mysqlRootPassword=mysqlpwd \
    --set redis.redisPassword=redispwd incubator/spring-cloud-data-flow

Welcome to the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell. For assistance hit TAB or type "help".
server-unknown:>
```
+
Configure the Data Flow server URI with the following command (use the URL determined above in the previous step) using the default user and password settings:
+
```
server-unknown:>dataflow config server --username user --password password --uri http://130.211.203.246/
Successfully targeted http://130.211.203.246/
dataflow:>
```
+
. Register the Docker with Rabbit binder versions of the `time` and `log` apps using the shell.
+
[subs=attributes]
```
dataflow:>app register --type source --name time --uri docker://springcloudstream/time-source-rabbit:{docker-time-source-rabbit-version} --metadata-uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:time-source-rabbit:jar:metadata:{docker-time-source-rabbit-version}

```
+
. Alternatively, if you would like to register all out-of-the-box stream applications built with the Rabbit binder in bulk,
you can with the following command. For more details, review how to link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-dataflow-register-apps.html[register applications].
+
```
dataflow:>app import --uri http://bit.ly/Celsius-SR1-stream-applications-rabbit-docker
```
+
. Deploy a simple stream in the shell
+
```
dataflow:>stream create --name ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy
```
+
You can use the command `kubectl get pods` to check on the state of the pods corresponding to this stream. We can run this from the shell by running it as an OS command by adding a "!" before the command.
+
```

. Destroy the stream
+
```
dataflow:>stream destroy --name ticktock
```
+
A useful command to help in troubleshooting issues, such as a container that has a fatal error starting up, add the options `--previous` to view last terminated container log. You can also get more detailed information about the pods by using the `kubctl describe` like:
+
```
kubectl describe pods/ticktock-log-qnk72
```
+
NOTE: If you need to specify any of the app specific configuration properties then you might use "long-form" of them including the app specific prefix like `--jdbc.tableName=TEST_DATA`. This form is *required* if you didn't register the `--metadata-uri` for the Docker based starter apps. In this case you will also not see the configuration properties listed when using the `app info` command or in the Dashboard GUI.

=== Create Streams with Skipper
Refer to the section <<streams-using-skipper>> for more information.

=== Accessing app from outside the cluster

If you need to be able to connect to from outside of the Kubernetes cluster to an app that you deploy, like the `http-source`, then you need to use either an external load balancer for the incoming connections or you need to use a NodePort configuration that will expose a proxy port on each Kubetnetes Node. If your cluster doesn't support external load balancers, like the Minikube, then you must use the NodePort approach. You can use deployment properties for configuring the access. Use  `deployer.http.kubernetes.createLoadBalancer=true` for the app to specify that you want to have a LoadBalancer with an external IP address created for your app's service. For the NodePort configuration use `deployer.http.kubernetes.createNodePort=<port>` where `<port>` should be a number between 30000 and 32767.

. Register the `http-source`, you can use the following command:
+
[subs=attributes]
```
dataflow:>app register --type source --name http --uri docker//springcloudstream/http-source-rabbit:{docker-http-source-rabbit-version} --metadata-uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:http-source-rabbit:jar:metadata:{docker-http-source-rabbit-version}
```
+
. Create the `http | log` stream without deploying it using the following command:
+
```
dataflow:>stream create --name test --definition "http | log"
```
+
. If your cluster supports an External LoadBalancer for the `http-source`, then you can use the following command to deploy the stream:
+
```
dataflow:>stream deploy test --properties "deployer.http.kubernetes.createLoadBalancer=true"
```
Wait for the pods to be started showing 1/1 in the READY column by using this command:
+
```
dataflow:>! kubectl get pods -l role=spring-app
command is:kubectl get pods -l role=spring-app
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test-http-2bqx7    1/1       Running   0          3m
test-log-0-tg1m4   1/1       Running   0          3m
```
Now, look up the external IP address for the `http` app (it can sometimes take a minute or two for the external IP to get assigned):
+
```
dataflow:>! kubectl get service test-http
command is:kubectl get service test-http
NAME         CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)    AGE
test-http    10.103.251.157   130.211.200.96   8080/TCP   58s
```
. If you are using Minikube, or any cluster that doesn't support an External LoadBalancer, then you should deploy the stream with a NodePort in the range of 30000-32767. Use the following command to deploy it:
+
```
dataflow:>stream deploy test --properties "deployer.http.kubernetes.createNodePort=32123"
```
+
Wait for the pods to be started showing 1/1 in the READY column by using this command:
+
```
dataflow:>! kubectl get pods -l role=spring-app
command is:kubectl get pods -l role=spring-app
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test-http-9obkq    1/1       Running   0          3m
test-log-0-ysiz3   1/1       Running   0          3m
```
Now look up the URL to use with the following command:
+
```
dataflow:>! minikube service --url test-http
command is:minikube service --url test-http
http://192.168.99.100:32123
```
+
. Post some data to the `test-http` app either using the EXTERNAL-IP address from above with port 8080 or the URL provided by the minikube command:
+
```
dataflow:>http post --target http://130.211.200.96:8080 --data "Hello"
```
+
. Finally, look at the logs for the `test-log` pod:
+
```
dataflow:>! kubectl get pods-l role=spring-app
command is:kubectl get pods-l role=spring-app
NAME              READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
test-http-9obkq   1/1       Running            0          2m
test-log-0-ysiz3  1/1       Running            0          2m
dataflow:>! kubectl logs test-log-0-ysiz3
command is:kubectl logs test-log-0-ysiz3
...

```
+
. Destroy the stream
+
```
dataflow:>stream destroy --name test
```


== Deploying Tasks

. Create a task and launch it
+
Let's register the `timestamp` task app and create a simple task definition and launch it.
+
[subs=attributes]
```
dataflow:>app register --type task --name timestamp --uri docker:springcloudtask/timestamp-task:{docker-timestamp-task-version} --metadata-uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.task.app:timestamp-task:jar:metadata:{docker-timestamp-task-version}
dataflow:>task create task1 --definition "timestamp"
dataflow:>task launch task1
```
We can now list the tasks and executions using these commands:
+
[options=nowrap]
```
dataflow:>task list
╔═════════╤═══════════════╤═══════════╗
║Task Name│Task Definition│Task Status║
╠═════════╪═══════════════╪═══════════╣
║task1    │timestamp      │running    ║
╚═════════╧═══════════════╧═══════════╝

dataflow:>task execution list
╔═════════╤══╤════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╤═════════╗
║Task Name│ID│         Start Time         │          End Time          │Exit Code║
╠═════════╪══╪════════════════════════════╪════════════════════════════╪═════════╣
║task1    │1 │Fri May 05 18:12:05 EDT 2017│Fri May 05 18:12:05 EDT 2017│0        ║
╚═════════╧══╧════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╧═════════╝
```
+
. Destroy the task
+
```
dataflow:>task destroy --name task1
```

== Application Configuration

This section covers how you can customize the deployment of your applications. You can use a number of deployer properties to influence settings for the applications that are deployed.

See https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/kubernetes/KubernetesDeployerProperties.java[KubernetesDeployerProperties] for more of the supported options.

If you would like to override the default values for all apps that you deploy then you should modify the <<index.html#_spring_cloud_deployer_for_kubernetes_properties, Spring Cloud Deployer for Kubernetes Properties>> for the server.

=== Memory and CPU Settings

The apps are deployed by default with the following "Limits" and "Requests" settings:

```
    Limits:
      cpu:	500m
      memory:	512Mi
    Requests:
      cpu:	500m
      memory:	512Mi
```

You might find that the 512Mi memory limit is too low and to increase it you can provide a common `spring.cloud.deployer.memory` deployer property like this (replace <app> with the name of the app you would like to set this for):

```
deployer.<app>.memory=640m
```

This property affects bot the Requests and Limits memory value set for the container.

If you would like to set the Requests and Limits values separately you would have to use the deployer properties that are specific to the Kubernetes deployer. To set the Limits to 1000m for cpu, 1024Mi for memory and Requests to 800m for cpu, 640Mi for memory you can use the following properties:

```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.limits.cpu=1000m
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.limits.memory=1024Mi
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.requests.cpu=800m
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.requests.memory=640Mi
```

That should result in the following container settings being used:

```
    Limits:
      cpu:	1
      memory:	1Gi
    Requests:
      cpu:	800m
      memory:	640Mi
```

NOTE: When using the common memory property you should use and `m` suffix for the value while when using the Kubernetes specific properties you should use the Kubernetes `Mi` style suffix.

The settings we have used so far only affect the settings for the container, they do not affect the memory setting for the JVM process in the container. If you would like to set JVM memory settings you can provide an environment variable for this, see the next section for details.

=== Environment Variables

To influence the environment settings for a given app, you can take advantage of the `spring.cloud.deployer.kubernetes.environmentVariables` deployer property.
For example, a common requirement in production settings is to influence the JVM memory arguments.
This can be achieved by using the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable:

```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.environmentVariables=JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xmx1024m
```

[NOTE]
The `environmentVariables` property accepts a comma delimited string. If an environment variable contains a value
which is also a comma delimited string, then it must be enclosed in single quotes, e.g.,
`spring.cloud.deployer.kubernetes.environmentVariables=spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers='somehost:9092,
anotherhost:9093'`

This overrides the JVM memory setting for the desired <app> (just replace <app> with the name of your app).

=== Liveness and Readiness Probes

The _liveness_ and _readiness_ probes are using the _paths_ `/health` and `/info` respectively. They use a _delay_ of 10 for both and a _period_ of 60 and 10 respectively. You can change these defaults when you deploy the stream by using deployer properties.

Here is an example changing the _liveness_ probe (just replace <app> with the name of your app):

```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.livenessProbePath=/health
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.livenessProbeDelay=120
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.livenessProbePeriod=20
```

Similarly, swap _liveness_ for _readiness_ to override the default readiness settings.

By default, port 8080 is used as the probe port. You can change the defaults for both _liveness_ and _readiness_ probe ports by using deployer properties, for example:

```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.readinessProbePort=7000
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.livenessProbePort=7000
```

[NOTE]
====
If you intend to use Spring Boot 2.x+, please note that all Actuator endpoints in Spring Boot 2.x have been moved under `/actuator` by default. You _must_ adjust the liveness and readiness probe paths to the new defaults. Here is an example of configuring Spring Boot 2.x+ _liveness_ and _readiness_ endpoint paths (just replace <app> with the name of your app):

```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.livenessProbePath=/actuator/health
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.readinessProbePath=/actuator/info
```

If desired, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide#base-path[Spring Boot 2.0 Migration Guide] for more information and how to restore the Spring Boot 1.x base path behavior.

====

=== Private Docker Registry

Docker images can be pulled from a private registry on a per app basis. First a Secret must be created in the cluster. Follow the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/[Pull an Image from a Private Registry] guide to create the Secret.

Once the Secret is created, use the `imagePullSecret` property to set the Secret to use, for example:

```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.imagePullSecret=mysecret
```

Replacing `<app>` with the name of your app and `mysecret` with the name of the Secret you created earlier.

=== Annotations

Annotations can be added to Kubernetes objects on a per app basis. The supported object types are pod `Deployment`, `Service` and `Job`. Annotations are defined in a `key:value` format allowing for multiple annotations separated by a comma. For more information and use cases on annotations see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[Annotations].

Applications can be configured as such:

[options=nowrap]
```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.podAnnotations=annotationName:annotationValue
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.serviceAnnotations=annotationName:annotationValue,annotationName2:annotationValue2
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.jobAnnotations=annotationName:annotationValue
```

Replacing `<app>` with the name of your app and the value of your annotation(s).

=== Entry Point Style

An Entry Point Style affects how application properties are passed to the container to be deployed. Currently there are three supported styles:

* `exec` - The default Entry Point Style and passes all application properties as command line arguments
* `shell` - Passes all application properties as environment variables
* `boot` - Creates an environment variable `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` containing a JSON representation of all application properties

Applications can be configured as such:

[options=nowrap]
```
deployer.<app>.kubernetes.entryPointStyle=entryPointStyle
```

Replacing `<app>` with the name of your app and the desired Entry Point Style.

Choosing an Entry Point Style of either `exec` or `shell` corresponds to how the `ENTRYPOINT` syntax is defined in the containers `Dockerfile`. For more information and uses cases on `exec` vs `shell` see the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[ENTRYPOINT] section of the Docker documentation.

Using the Entry Point Style of `boot` corresponds to using the `exec` style `ENTRYPOINT`. Command line arguments from the deployment request are passed to the container, with the addition of application properties mapped into the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` environment variable rather than command line arguments. When using the `boot` Entry Point Style, the `deployer.<app>.kubernetes.environmentVariables` property must not contain `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`.
