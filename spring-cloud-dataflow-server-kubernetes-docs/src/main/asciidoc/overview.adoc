== Spring Cloud Data Flow
Spring Cloud Data Flow is a cloud-native orchestration service for composable data microservices on modern runtimes. With Spring Cloud Data Flow, developers can create and orchestrate data pipelines for common use cases such as data ingest, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

The Spring Cloud Data Flow architecture consists of a server that deploys http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#streams[Streams] and http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-task[Tasks].  Streams are defined using a http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#_stream_dsl[DSL] or visually through the browser based designer UI.  Streams are based on the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Spring Cloud Stream] programming model while Tasks are based on the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/[Spring Cloud Task] programming model. The sections below describe more information about creating your own custom Streams and Tasks

For more details about the core architecture components and the supported features, please review Spring Cloud Data Flow's http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/[core reference guide]. There're several https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples[samples] available for reference.

== Spring Cloud Stream
Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications. Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications, and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers. It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

For more details about the core framework components and the supported features, please review Spring Cloud Stream's http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/[reference guide].

There's a rich ecosystem of Spring Cloud Stream http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/docs/{scst-starters-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle[Application-Starters] that can be used either as standalone data microservice applications or in Spring Cloud Data Flow. For convenience, we have generated RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka variants of these application-starters that are available for use from https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloudstream/[Docker Hub] as docker images.

Do you have a requirement to develop custom applications? No problem. Refer to this guide to create http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/docs/{scst-starters-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#_creating_custom_artifacts[custom stream applications]. There're several https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples[samples] available for reference.

== Spring Cloud Task

Spring Cloud Task makes it easy to create short-lived microservices. We provide capabilities that allow short-lived JVM processes to be executed on demand in a production environment.

For more details about the core framework components and the supported features, please review Spring Cloud Task's http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/docs/{sct-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/[reference guide].

There's a rich ecosystem of Spring Cloud Task http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task-app-starters/docs/{sct-starters-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle[Application-Starters] that can be used either as standalone data microservice applications or in Spring Cloud Data Flow. For convenience, the generated application-starters are available for use from https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloudtask/[Docker Hub] as docker images.
