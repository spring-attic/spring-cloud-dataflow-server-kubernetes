In this section you will learn how to configure Spring Cloud Data Flow server's features such as the relational database to use and security.
--

[[enable-disable-specific-features]]
== Feature Toggles

Data Flow server offers specific set of features that can be enabled/disabled when launching. These features include all the lifecycle operations, REST endpoints (server, client implementations including Shell and the UI) for:

. Streams
. Tasks
. Analytics

You can enable or disable these features by setting the following boolean environment variables when launching the Data Flow server:

* `SPRING_CLOUD_DATAFLOW_FEATURES_STREAMS_ENABLED`
* `SPRING_CLOUD_DATAFLOW_FEATURES_TASKS_ENABLED`
* `SPRING_CLOUD_DATAFLOW_FEATURES_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`

By default, all the features are enabled.

NOTE: Since analytics feature is enabled by default, the Data Flow server is expected to have a valid Redis store available as analytic repository as we provide a default implementation of analytics based on Redis. This also means that the Data Flow server's `health` depends on the redis store availability as well. If you do not want to enable HTTP endpoints to read analytics data written to Redis, then disable the analytics feature using the property mentioned above.

The REST endpoint `/features` provides information on the features enabled/disabled.

[[configuration-general]]
== General Configuration

The Spring Cloud Data Flow server for Kubernetes uses the Fabric8 https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes[`spring-cloud-kubernetes`] module to process both ConfigMap and Secrets settings. You just need to enable the ConfigMap support by passing in an environment variable of `SPRING_CLOUD_KUBERNETES_CONFIG_NAME` and setting that to the name of the ConfigMap. Same is true for the Secrets where the environment variable is `SPRING_CLOUD_KUBERNETES_SECRETS_NAME`. To use the Secrets you also need to set `SPRING_CLOUD_KUBERNETES_SECRETS_ENABLE_API` to true.

Here is an example of a snippet from a deployment that sets these environment variables.

[source,yaml]
----
        env:
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_KUBERNETES_SECRETS_ENABLE_API
          value: 'true'
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_KUBERNETES_SECRETS_NAME
          value: mysql
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_KUBERNETES_CONFIG_NAME
          value: scdf-server
----

=== Using ConfigMap and Secrets

Configuration properties can be passed to the Data Flow Server using Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/[ConfigMap] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets]. 

An example configuration could look like the following where we configure Rabbit MQ, MySQL and Redis as well as basic security settings for the server:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: scdf-server
  labels:
    app: scdf-server
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    security:
      basic:
        enabled: true
        realm: Spring Cloud Data Flow
    spring:
      cloud:
        dataflow:
          security:
            authentication:
              file:
                enabled: true
                users:
                  admin: admin, ROLE_MANAGE, ROLE_VIEW
                  user: password, ROLE_VIEW, ROLE_CREATE
        deployer:
          kubernetes:
            environmentVariables: 'SPRING_RABBITMQ_HOST=${RABBITMQ_SERVICE_HOST},SPRING_RABBITMQ_PORT=${RABBITMQ_SERVICE_PORT},SPRING_REDIS_HOST=${REDIS_SERVICE_HOST},SPRING_REDIS_PORT=${REDIS_SERVICE_PORT}'
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST}:${MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT}/mysql
        username: root
        password: ${mysql-root-password}
        driverClassName: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
        testOnBorrow: true
        validationQuery: "SELECT 1"
      redis:
        host: ${REDIS_SERVICE_HOST}
        port: ${REDIS_SERVICE_PORT}
----

We assume here that Rabbit MQ is deployed using `rabbitmq` as the service name. For MySQL we assume the service name is `mysql` and for Redis we assume it is `redis`. Kubernetes will publish these services' host and port values as environment variables that we can use when configuring the apps we deploy.

We prefer to provide the MySQL connection password in a Secrets file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
data:
  mysql-root-password: eW91cnBhc3N3b3Jk
----

The password is provided as a base64 encoded value.

[[configuration-rdbms]]
== Database Configuration

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides schemas for H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2 and SQL Server that will be automatically created when the server starts.

The JDBC drivers for *MySQL* (via MariaDB driver), *HSQLDB*, *PostgreSQL* along with embedded *H2* are available out of the box.
If you are using any other database, then the corresponding JDBC driver jar needs to be on the classpath of the server.

For instance,
If you are using *MySQL* in addition to password in the Secrets file provide the following properties in the ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST}:${MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT}/mysql
        username: root
        password: ${mysql-root-password}
        driverClassName: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
        url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST}:${MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT}/test
        driverClassName: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
----

For *PostgreSQL*:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://${PGSQL_SERVICE_HOST}:${PGSQL_SERVICE_PORT}/database
        username: root
        password: ${postgres-password}
        driverClassName: org.postgresql.Driver
----

For *HSQLDB*:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://${HSQLDB_SERVICE_HOST}:${HSQLDB_SERVICE_PORT}/database
        username: sa
        driverClassName: org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver
----

NOTE: There is a schema update to the Spring Cloud Data Flow datastore when upgrading from version `1.0.x` to `1.1.x` and from `1.1.x` to `1.2.x`.
Migration scripts for specific database types can be found in the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-core/src/main/resources/org/springframework/cloud/task/migration[spring-cloud-task] repo.


[[configuration-security]]
== Security

We are now securing the server application in the sample configurations file used in the <<kubernetes-getting-started,Getting Started section>>.

This section covers the basic configuration settings we provide in the provided sample configuration, please refer to the  link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security[core security documentation] for more detailed coverage of the security configuration options for the Spring Cloud Data Flow server and shell.

The security settings in the `src/kubernetes/server/server-config-rabbit.yaml` file are:
[source,yaml]
----
    security:
      basic:
        enabled: true                                         # <1>
        realm: Spring Cloud Data Flow                         # <2>
    spring:
      cloud:
        dataflow:
          security:
            authentication:
              file:
                enabled: true
                users:
                  admin: admin, ROLE_MANAGE, ROLE_VIEW        # <3>
                  user: password, ROLE_VIEW, ROLE_CREATE      # <4>
----

<1> Enable security
<2> Optionally set the realm, defaults to "Spring"
<3> Create an 'admin' user with password set to 'admin' that can view apps, streams and tasks and that can also view management endpoints
<4> Create a 'user' user with password set to 'password' than can register apps and create streams and tasks and also view them

Feel free to change user names and passwords to suite, and also maybe move the definition of user passwords to a Kubernetes Secret.

== Spring Cloud Deployer for Kubernetes Properties

The Spring Cloud Deployer for Kubernetes has several properties you can use to configure the apps that it deploys.
You can control the default values to set the `cpu` and `memory` requirements for the pods that are created as part of app deployments.
The configuration is controlled by configuration properties under the `spring.cloud.deployer.kubernetes` prefix.
For example you might declare the following as part of the container env section in a deployment YAML file.

```
        env:
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_KUBERNETES_CPU
          value: 500m
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_KUBERNETES_MEMORY
          value: 640Mi
```

You can modify the settings used for the liveness and readiness probes. This might be necessary if your cluster is slower and the apps need more time to start up. Here is an example of setting the delay and period for the liveness probe:

```
        env:
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_KUBERNETES_LIVENESS_PROBE_DELAY
          value: '120'
        - name: SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_KUBERNETES_LIVENESS_PROBE_PERIOD
          value: '45'
```

See https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/kubernetes/KubernetesDeployerProperties.java[KubernetesDeployerProperties] for more of the supported options.

Data Flow Server properties that are common across all of the Data Flow Server implementations including the configuration of maven repository settings can be set in a similar manner although the latter might be easier to set using a `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` environment variable like:

[options=nowrap]
```
        env:
        - name: SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON
          value: "{ \"maven\": { \"local-repository\": null, \"remote-repositories\": { \"repo1\": { \"url\": \"https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot\"} } } }"

```

[[configuration-monitoring-management]]
== Monitoring and Management

We recommend using the `kubectl` command for troubleshooting streams and tasks. 

You can list all artifacts and resources used by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get all,cm,secrets,pvc
----

You can list all resources used by a specific app or service by using a label to select resources. The following command list all resources used by the `mysql` service:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get all -l app=mysql
----

You can get the logs for a specific pod by issuing:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs pod <pod-name>
----

If the pod is continuously getting restarted you can add `-p` as an option to see the previous log like:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs -p <pod-name>
----

You can also tail or follow a log by adding an `-f` option:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
----

A useful command to help in troubleshooting issues, such as a container that has a fatal error starting up, is to use the describe command like:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe pod ticktock-log-0-qnk72
----

=== Inspecting Server Logs

You can access the server logs by using the following command (just supply the name of pod for the server):

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pod -l app=scdf=server
kubectl logs <scdf-server-pod-name>
----

=== Streams

The stream apps are deployed with the stream name followed by the name of the app and for processors and sinks there is also an instance index appended. 

To see all the pods that are deployed by the Spring Cloud Data Flow server you can specify the label `role=spring-app`:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pod -l role=spring-app
----

To see details for a specific app deployment you can use (just supply the name of pod for the app):

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe pod <app-pod-name>
----

For the application logs use:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs <app-pod-name>
----

If you would like to tail a log you can use:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs -f <app-pod-name>
----

=== Tasks

Tasks are launched as bare pods without a replication controller. The pods remain after the tasks complete and this gives you an opportunity to review the logs. 

To see all pods for a specific task use this command while providing the task name:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pod -l task-name=<task-name>
----

To review the task logs use:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs <task-pod-name>
----

You have two options to delete completed pods. You can delete them manually once they are no longer needed.

To delete the task pod use:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete pod <task-pod-name>
----

You can also use the Data Flow shell command `task execution cleanup` command to remove the completed pod for a task execution.

First we need to determine the `ID` for the task execution:

[source,shell]
----
dataflow:>task execution list 
╔═════════╤══╤════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╤═════════╗
║Task Name│ID│         Start Time         │          End Time          │Exit Code║
╠═════════╪══╪════════════════════════════╪════════════════════════════╪═════════╣
║task1    │1 │Fri May 05 18:12:05 EDT 2017│Fri May 05 18:12:05 EDT 2017│0        ║
╚═════════╧══╧════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╧═════════╝
----

Next we issue the command to cleanup the execution artifacts (the completed pod):

[source,shell]
----
dataflow:>task execution cleanup --id 1
Request to clean up resources for task execution 1 has been submitted
----
